# Amphibios

The purpose of Amphibios is to accumulate detailed information
on the system where Amphibios was launched without introducing
or installing applications on the system itself. The use of
Amphibios can be correlated with either a system administrator
documenting and detailing information on the system, or one can
use the information for other means. For example, in performing
a host based penetration test, the information gathered via say
installed patches will allow a tester to determine the possible
exposure state due to patches that weren't installed.

Amphibios gathers information on all applications, patches,
users, groups and diskspace on a machine. By putting this info
all into one repository, the data can be used for multiple
purposes.
